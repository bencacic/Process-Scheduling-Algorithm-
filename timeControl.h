   Description: This function serves to calculate the mean response 
   time for the processes. Formula used for Mean RT is: (sum of time the processes were
   first started - when it entered the ready queue) / # of processes. 
   Response time is the Duration between entering the ready queue and

   Description: This function takes the # of processes completed, and 
   divides them by the total time spent to completes all processes. Mean TP
   formula used is: # of processes / total time to complete processes.
